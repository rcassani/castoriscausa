My name is Raymundo Cassani, currently I am a [Research Software Engineer](https://ukrse.github.io/who.html) in the [Brainstorm](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Introduction) team at the [neuroSPEED Lab](https://www.neurospeed-bailletlab.org/), in the Montreal Neurological Institute. Overall, I have more than ten years of experience in **signal processing** and **machine learning** applied to physiological signals, mainly EEG ⚡🧠, MEG 🧲🧠, ECG ⚡❤️, respiration, and PPG, and short excursions on eye tracking, EOG, EMG, fNIRS and mmWave radar; all of this with for applications in health, entertainment, and mental workload and stress assessment. For example my PhD thesis was on the use of portable [EEG for detection of Alzheimer's disease](/posts/2020/02/28/phd-thesis-summary/).

With a background in electrical engineering, specifically communications and **electronics**, I'm a person who enjoys improving, repairing and modifying, also, "rarely" messing stuff 😢. I'm greatly amused by learning a bit of everything, to understand better how things work. My bet is that a bit of everything is better than everything of a bit. In this sense, I'm lucky and thankful for the interdisciplinary formation and eclectic experiences that have made of me a **resourceful problem solver**. Some of my beside-research interests are data visualization, [maps](/tags/gis/) 🗺️, FOSS 🛠️🐧, beavers 🦫, videogames, science fiction, languages, etc.

### The goal of this blog
* Sharing some of my work, projects, experiences, dilemmas and / or solutions to problems (with software, hardware, methods, etc.) that I've encountered and expended a significant amount of time on them. Hopefully this will serve as timesaver and inspiration to others (including future-me).

### Why CastorisCausa?
From Latin **Castoris** (or related to the beaver) and **Causa** (cause), then roughly: **"For the sake of the beaver"**.
The beaver (genus Castor), its nature and behaviour have always evoked my admiration and sympathy; being a semi-aquatic animal, it gets the best of two worlds. The beaver is the vivid description of hard work, dexterity and ingenuity. Not surprisingly, it has been taken as mascot by several engineering schools around the world.
