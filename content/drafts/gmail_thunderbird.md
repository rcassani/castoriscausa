Hi,

in this post I'll put som interesting trick for synchronization between Thunderbird and Gmail
This assumes that you have the IMAP option enabled in Gmail

Firsts, the things called Labels in Gmail are very useful to classify your emails, it's worth to note that you can assign various labels to the same email

Once you have configured your account in Thunderbird these Labels appears as Folders, by Default the folders synch under demand, if you want to do it automatically: Right click in each folder (and subfolders) -&gt; Properties -&gt; General Information, and check the option "When getting nrew message for this account; always check this folder"

Alternatively, you can create Gmail Labels on the browser or in Thunderbird by creating a Folder

An important aspect is that you should make the filters in Gmail, in this sense, you will have always those filters, if something -&gt; assign Label and archive (skip Inbox)

Another anoying point is that the folders Draft, Sent, Span and Bin a appear under the Folder "[Gmail]" . You can avoid this using the Thunderbird add-on: Flat Folder Tree (Link). Right click in [Gmail] and select Promote Subfolder

To homogenize, create the same signature in Gmail and Thunderbird, so no matter the origin of your email, I'll have the same signature, unless you want to indicate from where it was sent.
