When learning French, it is overwhelming the large quantity of [homophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophone); and if you come from a language with few vowels (like [Spanish with 5 vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language#Phonology)), the list of homophones gets "larger", because  many of the vowels in French (in some variations, up to [17 vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language#Phonology)) can be easily confused. While others hear an obstacle, I hear an golden opportunity for puns and [wordplays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_play). Among the last ones, this post aim to record some names for businesses in French that I've conceived. Feel free to use any of them, it will be amazing to see them in wild.
