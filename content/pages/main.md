## Hello Main,

My name is **Raymundo Cassani**, currently, I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher (Electrical Engineer - PhD) with an interdisciplinary formation, that includes biomedical signal processing with applications in health diagnostics, human-machine interaction  and neurotechnologies. With a background in electrical engineering, specifically telecommunications and electronics, I'm a person who finds enjoyment in improving, repairing, modifying, (often mess :( ) stuff. I find great joy at learning a bit of everything, my bet is that a bit of everything is better that everything of a bit. Some of my beside-research interests are data visualization, maps, beavers, videogames, science fiction, languages and (gear) mechanisms etc.
