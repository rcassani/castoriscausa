The documents listed in the previous post were very useful to understand the mechanisms and functioning of the typewriter. The first step to take in this journey will be to remove and clean the tabulator. This mechanism is located at the back of the typewriter, it is connected to three keys, X, X and X. This can be done with only flat screwdrivers of different sizes. Interestingly, there is an enormous variety in the length and width of the screws, it is recommended to have a tray with divisions to keep track of all the screws and their places.

### Setting up the typewriter
Before staring there are few details that will facilitate the process:
1. Move the left and right **marginal stops** towards the edges.  
  This is done by moving the small lever attached to them and sliding them to the left or right.
2. Clear all the tabs.
  To clear all the tabs in one movement, move the carriage to the extreme left, then press and hold the **Tab(ulator) Stop Clear** key, and move the carriage to the extreme right.
3. Remove all the plate covers from the typewriter, while this not needed, it allows to have extra light to manoeuver.

### Removing tabulator
1. Move the carriage to the extreme right and disconnect it from the main spring.  Hold the disconnected part and attached to the screw beside so it does not get retracted.

2. Remove the housing for the tabulator at the back of the typewriter. Unscrew four large screws at the bottom. Then pull gently the housing of the tabulator. Be careful as it is kind of hooked inside.

### Cleaning tabulator
This is the fun part. As reference to assembly I took as picture before and after.
