The energy consumption is measured as a X number of kWh (kilowatt hour), which are equivalent to Joules as: Watt [Joule/second] and hours[3600 seconds]. Then a kWh = 3.6 megaJoules (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt_hour)

Using a 100W light bulb during 1 hours results in a consumption of 0.1kWh, if the same bulb during 10hours gives a consumption of 1kWh

Watts are always Joules/seconds, no matter how they are calculated, for example in P = E I.  Voltage or Electric Potential (E) is given in Volts, which are defined as work per unit charge, this is [Volt] =  [Joules / Coulomb]. On the other hand, Electric Current (I), measured in Amps, indicates the quantity of charge per second, [amp] = [Coulomb/second]. Therefore P[Watts] = E[Volts] x I[Amps] = E[Joule/Coulomb] x I[Coulomb/second] = P[Joules/second]

Returning to the article if a charger's vampire power is 0.26W, in a month(considering it's in vampire-mode 20 hours per day) the energy vampire consumption is 0.26[W] x 30[day] x 20[hour/day] =  156Wh or 0.156kWh, assuming a price of 12.73cents of USD (USA average price) per kWh, the result is 0.02USD (2 cents) saving per month. With the unused laptop charger in the same conditions (20hrs vampire mode), there is a saving of 33cents per month by unplugging it when it not used.
