This is list of some of the projects I have contributed. Most of the code is already available in my [GitHub account](https://github.com/rcassani), or it is available under request.

* [**Brainstorm**](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/) is a collaborative, open-source application dedicated to the analysis of brain recordings: MEG, EEG, fNIRS, ECoG, iEEG, depth electrodes and multiunit electrophysiology. Brainstorm is developed with Matlab (and Java), it does not require users to own a Matlab license: an executable, platform-independent (Windows, MacOS, Linux) version is made available.  


* The [**MuSAE Lab EEG Server (MuLES)**](https://github.com/MuSAELab/MuLES) is an EEG acquisition and streaming server programmed in LabVIEW. It creates a standard interface for portable EEG. Latest version is compatible with Interaxon Muse (2014), Emotiv EEG, Neuroelectrics Enobio, and OpenBCI devices.  


* The [**Amplitude Modulation Analysis (AMA) Toolkit**](https://github.com/MuSAELab/amplitude-modulation-analysis-module) computes forward and inverse transformations between time, frequency, time-frequency and frequency-modulation-frequency domains. It also includes a GUI for the real-time exploration of the signals and their representations across different domains. The toolkit is available for Python3, Octave and MATLAB.


* Unity project to use a [Ricoh Theta S camera](https://theta360.com/en/about/theta/s.html) to live-stream 360Â° video to a VR headset.  
[https://github.com/rcassani/ThetaWifiStreaming2VRheadset](https://github.com/rcassani/ThetaWifiStreaming2VRheadset).

* The [**Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) Toolkit for LabVIEW**](https://github.com/MuSAELab/BLE-Toolkit-LabVIEW) is an implementation of the [BGAPI protocol v1.3](http://www.silabs.com/documents/login/reference-manuals/Bluetooth_Smart_Software-BLE-1.3-API-RM.pdf), that allows the communication with BLE devices over USB/UART in LabVIEW. The toolkit has been developed and tested with the [BLE USB dongle BLED112](http://www.silabs.com/products/wireless/bluetooth/bluetooth-low-energy-modules/ble121lr-bluetooth-smart-long-range-module1).  

* The [**OpenBCI Toolkit for LabVIEW**](https://github.com/rcassani/OpenBCI-Toolkit-LabVIEW) in a LabVIEW implementation of the [OpenBCI communication protocol](http://docs.openbci.com/OpenBCI%20Software/04-OpenBCI_Cyton_SDK). It allows the configuration and data acquistion from the **OpenBCI Cyton** board (using its **OpenBCI DONGLE**) for firmware 2.x or higher.

* The [**LabVIEW Emotiv Toolkit V2**](https://forums.ni.com/t5/Example-Programs/LabVIEW-Emotiv-Toolkit-V2/ta-p/3493301?profile.language=en) extends the V1 by adding the capability of acquiring raw EEG data from the Emotiv Epoc and Epoc+ headsets.

* [**neuralDrift**](https://github.com/hubertjb/neuraldrift) is a collaborative multiplayer neurogame based on brain-computer interfaces. The game consists in a LEGO&copy; MINDSTORMS&copy; EV3 robot, an Android device displaying the game state, and requires two EEG devices supported by [MuLES](https://github.com/MuSAELab/MuLES).
