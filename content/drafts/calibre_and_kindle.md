Books can be put in a category automatically, based on their metadata
This is not recommended as metadata can be messy

I'll use a Custom field to create Kindle collections
as in here: http://dearauthor.com/ebooks/using-kindle-collections-plugin-for-calibre/

1 . Right click in the title/author/date menu bar area. Select “Add Your Own Columns” and then add a column for kindle collections.

Quick create, click in Tags, as the field will behave as tags (several values, comma separated)
Lookup name: kindlecollections
Column heading: Kindle
Description: Collection names in kindle

Create Collections in Kindle from Calibre

Create Collection based on the Kindle column (create)
Create Collection based on Tag, when its value is Pocket
