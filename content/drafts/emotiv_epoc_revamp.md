There are some characteristics that

make difficult the use of the Emotiv-Epoc for experiments, two of the most mentioned are the electrode placement, which left apart some interesting places as:
the second limitation is the technology of the electrodes, as they require to be wet in saline solution, for long recordigns, the solution dries affecting the queality of the recording.

How about taking a low-cost, small, and wireless EEG for a walk? Paper Debener

In the MuSAE Lab, we had a Emotiv-Epoc which support structure was broken,

then following the steps of other laboratories and people, we engage in the process of removing the electronics from the EEG and give it a new case. This is a post on the Epoc revamp

The process consisted of three parts:

1. Stripping out the electronics from the Epoc

2. Replacing the battery and electrode cables

3. Place everything in a new casing

6. Test

1. Striping the electronics
This part was performed by Liviu Ivanescu, here some of the pictures.

2. Replacing the battery and electrode cables
A new battery was utilized to extend the life of the experiments, the battery XXX was utilized

The electrode cables were selected to fit any electrode in the future
We decided to but this cables, in order to be able to use the "hacked" Epoc with any standard electrode cable.

The soldering part is the more crucial, as screwing it screws the EEG that was funtion (but not useful with the broken structure)
Remember than the terminas on the PCB as trough hole, then it is not needed to put the cable again through it, a surface soldering will be enough

3. Pass cables it's called wiring grommet

4. Place everything in a new casing
The new casing was build having in consideration practicalliy and safety of the electrodes, as accidents always happen.

Finally the new casing was custom designed (on thikercad) and 3D printed in District 3.

6. The test
