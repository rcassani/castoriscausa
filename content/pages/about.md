## Hello,
</center>


My name is **Raymundo Cassani**, (Ray works perfectly for me). Currently, I'm a PhD candidate in Montr√©al, Canada. While my academic background is in electrical engineering, specifically telecommunications and electronics. I'm a person who finds enjoyment in repairing and / or modifying stuff. I love to learn a bit of everything, my bet is that a bit of everything more better that everything of a bit. Some of my interests are data visualization, maps, beavers, videogames, science fiction, karate, etc.

The principal goal of this blog, is:

* Share some of my work and experiences, walkthroughs, dilemmas or solutions to problems (with software, hardware, methods, etc.) I've encountered and expended a significant amount of time on them; hopefully this may serve as timesaver and inspiration to others (including a future-me).


Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy to write on it.

## **Why CastorisCausa.com?**
</br>
From Latin **Castoris** (or related to the beaver) and **Causa** (cause), then roughly:  
 **"For the sake of the beaver"**.

The beaver, its nature and behavior have always evoked my admiration and sympathy; being a semi-aquatic animal, it gets the best of two worlds. The beaver is the vivid description of hard work, dexterity and ingenuity. Not surprisingly, it has been taken as mascot by several engineering schools around the world.
