Few years ago I found this typewriter in a flea market, without double thinking I got it, as it would be nice to have a working old typewriter. According to the seller, the typewriter was functional and a quick cleaning should be enough to use it, thus, I put it aside for "later". Fortunately, this later has come.

This post the is first post of a Series where I'm going to document the cleaning process. By the end, I should have a nice old typewriter in working conditions, or a at least and nice pictures of how I mess with it. Without further delay, the beginning of the journey.

## Identifying the typewriter

Well, I'm ready to start to clean it. But I need (or at least I think) to know how it works in the big picture, the component parts, and how they work together. Thus step, tracking the model and manual. The typewriter's brand is [Underwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwood_Typewriter_Company), and has the serial number `S11-5784XXX`. The `S` makes reference to the *Model S*, indeed the look matches other typewriters from that model ([link](https://typewriterdatabase.com/Underwood.S.4.bmys)). The `11` just refers to the carriage lenght (11"). And `5784XXX` narrows the production date to 1945, between July and December (according to: [database 1](https://typewriterdatabase.com/underwood.6.typewriter-serial-number-database) and [database 2](https://www.oocities.org/heartland/cottage/5405/serial.htm#table_6)).

Searching for information, I found this amazing documents related to this specific model, and others that are similar:

2. [Instructions for Using The Underwood Typewriter](http://www.machinesoflovinggrace.com/manuals/Underwood3-5manual.pdf) for Models 3, 4 and 5.

After reading some the user manuals, items **1** and **2**, I got the conclusion that the major parts of the typewriter are working well, although it seems to be a problem with the Variable Line Spacer Button, number 29 in the image below. The next step is to read the maintenance and repair to have a good idea from where to start.
